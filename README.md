# Canvas Setup for Generative Art

## Overview
This document outlines the setup for an HTML5 canvas designed for the development and study of generative art. The platform allows the creation of dynamic art through coded rules and algorithms, providing an interactive and educational experience for artists, programmers, and students.

## Project Structure
```
/projeto-canvas-arte-generativa
|-- index.html: Basic project structure with canvas and UI elements.
|-- css/
|   `-- style.css: Styles to customize the appearance of the canvas and UI.
|-- js/
|   `-- script.js: Scripts for generative drawing and canvas interactivity.
`-- README.md
```

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Open `index.html` in a compatible browser to start the application.
3. Interact with the canvas using the mouse as instructed.
4. Modify `js/script.js` to change or add drawing functionalities.

## Structured Grid for Spatial Reference
The canvas features a structured grid with coordinates that facilitate spatial planning for art. With this reference, artists can visually sketch their art using brush effects, such as neon colors. This visual feature not only aids in artistic composition but also provides a foundation for understanding the mathematical concepts involved in programming.

## Grid Implementation
The grid is generated by an algorithm that draws horizontal and vertical lines, forming squares marked with their coordinates. Artists can use these coordinates to precisely position graphic elements on the canvas, planning their art before starting the programming process.

## Development and Contribution
To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your feature (`git checkout -b new-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin new-feature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
